# Desktop configuration files for Skaha Users

This directory contains desktop configuration files for Skaha users to be placed in new user allocations (home folders).
The `desktop-config.tar` file is a tar archive that contains the necessary configuration files.  It will be put into a ConfigMap and mounted into the Skaha Tomcat container.

The `desktop` folder is the exploded view for ease of modification.
