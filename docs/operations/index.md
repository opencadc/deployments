## Key Responsibilities

### Release Management

- Coordinate releases using Release Please automation
- Review and merge release PRs with proper approvals
- Monitor post-release workflows and verify deployments
- Manage hotfixes and rollback procedures when needed

### Infrastructure Operations

- Deploy Helm charts and configuration overlays
- Manage environment-specific configurations (staging, production)
- Monitor platform health and respond to incidents
- Maintain secrets and access controls

### CI/CD Maintenance

- Keep GitHub Actions workflows up to date
- Manage repository secrets for Harbor registry access
- Monitor workflow runs and troubleshoot failures
- Update automation scripts and configuration files

## Tools & Technologies

The CANFAR deployment infrastructure relies on:

- **Kubernetes** - Container orchestration platform
- **Helm** - Package manager for Kubernetes applications
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD automation and workflows
- **Release Please** - Automated release management and changelog generation
- **Harbor** - Container registry for storing and distributing images
- **Cosign** - Container image signing and verification
- **MkDocs Material** - Documentation site generation

## Best Practices

1. **Always follow the release checklist** - Skip no steps to ensure consistent, reliable releases
2. **Test in staging first** - Validate changes in staging before promoting to production
3. **Monitor post-deployment** - Watch metrics and logs after every deployment
4. **Document incidents** - Capture lessons learned and update runbooks
5. **Keep secrets secure** - Rotate credentials regularly and limit access
6. **Maintain audit trails** - All changes go through pull requests with proper reviews
